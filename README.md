# Study on Life Expectancy and Possible Contributing Factors

## Introduction
Life expectancy is an essential indicator of population health, providing insights into country trends and opportunities for improvement. Numerous studies have explored the factors influencing life expectancy and health outcomes. Past research has examined the cost implications of healthcare, such as the RAND Corporation's studies, and how different countries have successfully improved life expectancies. In this study, we aim to delve deeper into the various factors influencing life expectancy and identify areas where improvements can enhance global health outcomes.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this analysis is derived from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Health Statistics 2022. It includes comprehensive information on life expectancy, GDP, health expenditure, education levels, and other relevant factors across OECD countries and beyond.

## Analysis Steps
The analysis includes the following steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the OECD Health Statistics dataset to ensure data integrity.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial exploration of the data to identify trends and relationships among variables.
3. **Regression Analysis**: Applying regression models to examine the impact of GDP, health expenditure, education levels, and other factors on life expectancy.
4. **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to illustrate key findings and trends.

## Results
Key findings from the analysis:
- Higher GDP per capita correlates with increased life expectancy.
- Greater health expenditure per capita is associated with longer life expectancy.
- Higher education levels are linked to improved life expectancy.
- [Other significant findings]

The results highlight potential areas for policy intervention and investment aimed at improving global health outcomes.

## Conclusion
This study contributes to the understanding of the factors influencing life expectancy and provides insights into how countries can improve their health outcomes. By focusing on economic, healthcare, and educational policies, governments and organizations can work towards increasing life expectancy and overall well-being.
